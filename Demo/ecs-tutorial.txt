Write a long tutorial explaining how to use Amazon ECS as a software developer.
Start from the basics of how OS containers and Docker work.
Include code samples about a single demo app.
The app uses Python Flask in the backend, React and Typescript in the frontend. Use PostgreSQL for the database.
For the app, make sure to include input validation, error handling, and logging.
Use an organized structure for files so that each group is in a different folder. Use different file names when possible.
Make the turorial avaiable as a blog post series (multiple articles) and as a video series (multiple episodes).
